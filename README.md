# RL-mid-term

### 2021 Fall Reinforcement Learning Mid project

This project is modified from https://github.com/wetliu/dqn_pytorch based on my
opinionated styles of coding.


#### Optimization method
* boost the training speed using Prioritized Experience Replay
* improve the performance using Dueling DQN

#### And here are a pre-trained weights that you can play with:

- model_109（./models/model_109）
- model_214（./models/model_214）

#### notes：

* You can run it in the cluster jupyterLab, or install a virtual environment pytorch in the local Anconda3 environment, and run it locally. 
* You need to pay attention to the version when installing Anconda3.
* Install some dependencies according to `requirements.freezed`.
